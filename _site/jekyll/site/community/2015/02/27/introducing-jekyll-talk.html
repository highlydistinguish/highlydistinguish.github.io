<p>We’re super excited to announce the launch of <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll Talk</a>, a Discourse forum for anything related to Jekyll!</p>

<p>The forum was set up by <a href="https://github.com/envygeeks">@envygeeks</a> to build a community more accessible to Jekyll users and more suitable for general discussion.</p>

<p>There’s already been a lot of interesting topics, including a <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/showcase-sites-made-using-jekyll/18">site showcase</a> and <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/poll-installation-priorities-for-3-0/106/9">a poll for Jekyll 3.0 priorities</a>.</p>

<p>Come join the fun!</p>
